        [ ] - A Passenger has a name and a favorite Vehicle.
        [ ] - Your program should assign passengers to the available vehicles.

    Example flow:

        The program generated the passenger:
        {name:"shlomi", favorite: PLANE}
        The agency has no PLANE available, so shlomy gets a taxi.
        Now the agency has one less taxi available.
